Retreat is a four-day workshop hosted by Thunderbird Marching Band each year; this is where we rehearse music, practice marching, and get to know one another better! Retreat is a great refresher for returning band members because they get to re-acquaint themselves with our marching style and our music. For new members, this is an awesome crash course in all our charts and our American corps-style marching. Plus, you’ll get to connect with new and returning students, get to know people in your faculties and programs, and get to know the sprawling UBC campus, giving you a head start over your fellow new students! 


## When is Retreat?
Currently, TMB has tentatively set the dates for Retreat to be August 30th to September 2nd. For more information, please give our [Facebook page](http://facebook.com/ubctmb) a like, where we’ll be posting updates as soon as we can!
