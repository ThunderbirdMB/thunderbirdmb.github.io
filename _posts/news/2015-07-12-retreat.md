Each year, the week before UBC classes start, the Thunderbird Marching Band hosts __Retreat__, four fun-filled days before classes start where we rehearse our music and marching, and get to bond as a band! For returning members, retreat is a chance to get your chops back in shape and refresh your marching skills. For new members, not only do you get to learn our marching style and music, but you also get to know the UBC campus, make many new first year and upper year friends, and get a head start as a member of one of UBC's fastest growing clubs, all before classes and even orientation starts.

##When is Retreat?
This year, retreat is held from Tuesday, September 1st through Friday, September 4th. Retreat runs from 10-5 on Tuesday and Wednesday, and 10-4 on Thursday and Friday, and the band will provide lunch each day. [Click here](https://goo.gl/r69uUy) for a detailed schedule of each day.
