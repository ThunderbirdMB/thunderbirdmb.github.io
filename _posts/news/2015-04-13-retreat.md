Each year, the week before UBC classes start, the Thunderbird Marching Band hosts __Retreat__, four fun-filled days before classes start where we rehearse our music and marching, and get to bond as a band! For returning members, retreat is a chance to get your chops back in shape and refresh your marching skills. For new members, not only do you get to learn our marching style and music, but you also get to know the UBC campus, make many new first year and upper year friends, and get a head start as a member of one of UBC's fastest growing clubs, all before classes and even orientation starts. If you live in residence, you even get to move in early and avoid the hassle on move-in day!

##When is Retreat?
For Fall 2015, Retreat will be held on September 1st-4th.

More details about Retreat will be posted shortly! Fill out an [interest form](www.thunderbirdband.ca/join/), and we'll get back to you with more info.
