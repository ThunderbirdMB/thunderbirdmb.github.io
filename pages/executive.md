### Drum Major: Nicolas Moss

Nic is a fifth-year civil engineering student. Before becoming drum major, he played quint toms with the TMB drumline, but has also been seen playing snare drum, bass drum, glockenspiel, piano, cello, clarinet, and vibraslap. His favourite thing about the band is that it is an opportunity to relax from a busy week of classes and enjoy making music with friends.

## Staff
### Vice President: Nadia Kovari
<vp@thunderbirdband.ca>

Nadia is a third year majoring in International Relations. She plays the trombone, which is far superior than the trumpet. Her favorite thing about the band is everyone’s level of commitment to come together to just play music and have fun! This year she’d love to see the band grow in members.
