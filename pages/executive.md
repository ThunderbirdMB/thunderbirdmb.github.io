## President: Vivienne Zhang
_<president@thunderbirdband.ca>_

Presently a second year undergraduate in the Faculty of Arts at UBC, Vivienne is more than delighted to participate in the Thunderbird Marching Band’s executive team. Vivienne spent her secondary school years in both Beijing, China and Coquitlam, BC, Canada. Over the past four years, rock music helped blossom her interest in learning new instruments such as drums, guitars, and basses, and now she plays the bass drum for the Thunderbird Marching Band. Aside from getting involved in the TMB, Vivienne is also a floor representative of House Dene and a member of the Totem Park Residence Association.

## Treasurer: Max Bogard
_<treasurer@thunderbirdband.ca>_

Max is a fifth year undergraduate student in the Vancouver School of Economics at UBC. He is originally from Irvine, California, where he spent four years marching trombone and euphonium with his high school marching band. His musical talents go beyond performance: he is an experienced arranger, with works performed at both the secondary school and university level in Canada and the United States. As a clinician, he teaches trombone to new members of the TMB, and serves as the low brass technician with the Vancouver chapter of the Tian Guo Marching Band. When not pursuing musical interests, he is an active member of Oxfam UBC, and is their representative to the Simon K.Y. Lee Global Lounge.

## Publicity Officer: Torr Chow
_<publicity@thunderbirdband.ca>_

Torr is currently a first year undergraduate student in the Faculty of Arts at UBC and is thrilled to be a part of the executive team. Even though their first instrument is technically the piano, once they started playing the alto saxophone, there was no going back. Torr has played in their secondary school's jazz band, which included a performance "for the Premier" (Said Premier was absent during the actual performance). Other than the Thunderbird Marching Band, they are a member of the Speech and Linguistics Student Association and a junior student in the Arts Tri-Mentoring Program.
