At only three years old, the Thunderbird Marching Band is one of the youngest university marching bands in North America. We are an entirely student-run organization, led by a six-member executive council and student staff. Because of this, the band provides UBC students not only with a musical performance opportunity, but with valuable leadership experience as well. The band is grateful for the funding we receive from Athletics and the AMS, but we rely on support from donors in order to keep growing.

The easiest way to give to the band is to make a credit card payment online. Just [click here](https://www.donate.startanevolution.ca/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1730&ea.campaign.id=40861), and select "Thunderbird Marching Band" from the list of teams.

Don't have a credit card? You can still donate by mailing a cheque (in Canadian or US dollars) addressed to "AMS Thunderbird Marching Band"  to:

__Thunderbird Marching Band  
6138 Student Union Blvd  
Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1  
Canada__

We ask that you notify us at <treasurer@thunderbirdband.ca> before mailing a cheque in order to ensure that it is forwarded to us in a timely fashion, as well as to let us know if you would like to donate with recognition or anonymously. The band greatly appreciates donors who can contribute any amount, as small donations help us with the costs of unexpected instrument repairs, tuners, food for our new members at our annual August retreat, and guest clinicians.

##Sponsor an Instrument
While flute, clarinet, saxophone, and trumpet players perform with the band on their own instruments, members of other sections such as the low brass and drumline do not typically own their instruments. To allow these members to perform with the band, we need to provide them with quality instruments. By sponsoring an instrument, you are giving a UBC student an opportunity to continue with music that otherwise would not be available to them.

Listed below are the costs of the instruments we provide:

 * Piccolos: $800
 * Mellophones (Marching French Horns): $1700
 * Trombones: $600
 * Marching Baritones (Euphoniums): $2200
 * Sousaphones: $4500
 * Marching Snare Drums: $1000
 * Marching Quint Toms: $2000
 * Marching Bass Drums: $1000
 * Marching Cymbals: $300
 * Glockenspiels: $1400

These instruments are expensive because the band only buys instruments built to last from trusted manufacturers. When you sponsor an instrument for the band, you can be assured that your contribution will be make an impact for at least ten years. At this time, the band is especially in need of snare drums, quint toms, bass drums, and cymbals as we grow our drumline.

If you sponsor an instrument, we will recognize you on our website as well as with an engraving on its case, unless you wish to donate anonymously.

We also accept the donation of certain used instruments in acceptable condition. If you have a used instrument you believe the band can make use of, email us at <logistics@thunderbirdband.ca>.
