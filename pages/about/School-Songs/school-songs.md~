In addition to performing covers of music from a wide variety of genres (rock, top 40, movies, video games, and more!), the Thunderbird Marching Band is responsible for performing UBC's school songs at sporting events. Listed below are the lyrics to UBC's four fight songs and our Alma Mater.

## Hail UBC
>Hail to the Thunderbirds,
>Hail UBC,
>Thunder and lightning,
>Onward to victory!
>Hail to the blue and gold,
>Hail UBC,
>UBC forever!
>Onward to victory
