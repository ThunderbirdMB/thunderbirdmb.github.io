The Thunderbird Marching Band, or __TMB__, founded in September 2012, is the University of British Columbia's marching and pep band. Our purpose is to foster school spirit, support UBC Athletics and the surrounding community, and provide a fun musical performance opportunity for UBC students, alumni, and community members. We perform at UBC Thunderbirds games, as well as at other various events in the Lower Mainland. The TMB is one of only four university-level marching bands in Canada, and the only one west of Ontario.

## A Student-Run Band
The TMB is one of nine student-run marching bands in North America. Our members organize performances, write our halftime shows, select the music we play, and promote the band to the UBC campus and beyond. Not only do our members gain musical experience by participating in the band, they gain leadership experience as well! Our elected six-member [executive](/about/executive/) manages the band behind-the scenes, while our student staff ensure that rehearsals and performances run smoothly.

## Where We Perform
The bulk of our performances take place at UBC Thunderbirds athletics events, including football, hockey, basketball, volleyball, rugby, and soccer! Even our musicians who never watched sports before attending UBC find that they love cheering on the teams of Canada's most successful university athletics program! Along with our Athletics gigs, we have also performed for other groups on campus, such as our parent organization the Alma Mater Society, Blank Vinyl Project, and UBC Residence Life. We've even performed a few off campus gigs in Richmond and Downtown Vancouver!


If you would like the band to perform at your event, email us and we will let you know our availability We typically charge a small, negotiable performance fee.
